	                Sate Tegal or Sate Kambing Tegal is satay from Tegal, Slawi, and surrounding areas made from mutton or young lamb, cut into cubes (±1.5 - 2 cm) arranged on a bamboo skewer combined with fat (gajih) and liver or kidney. Then the sate meat is grilled over wood charcoal coals or coconut shell charcoal until cooked. The aroma that comes from burning this satay has a very distinctive smell. How to burn does not need to be dipped in diluted sweet soy sauce but as is, aka plain. If you ask to be grilled plain in a satay stall in Yogyakarta, this method is close to the original method of grilling in Tegal, mutton which may not be the same as in Tegal. Sate Tegal is usually served with soy sauce seasoning consisting of sweet soy sauce, cayenne pepper, shallots and tomatoes. In Tegal, satay is sold in kodi units (= 20 skewers) and usually costs IDR 80,000 to IDR 90,000.
	                <br><br>

	                Sate Kambing Tegal in Jakarta is known as Sate Kambing Muda Tegal. In Tegal it is called Sate Kambing Balibul from the slopes of Mount Slamet, the area of ​​Mount Guci, to the foot of the mountains in the Slawi and Adiwerna (Benjaran) areas and also in the city of Tegal. Tegal itself became the first city to introduce satay with raw materials for young goats under five months old, or commonly called balibul.
	                <br><br>

	                Sate Tegal contains high cholesterol so that some people cannot enjoy it freely. Sate Tegal is usually eaten with fluffy white rice or rice cake with delicious goat curry. What distinguishes Tegal satay from other regional satays is the relatively larger piece of meat compared to satay from other regions. The meat is selected from young goat and lamb, resulting in a very tender satay.

	               This makes the taste of Soto very distinctive with a combination of sweet, sour, salty, and the aroma of Tauco.
