	            	Pantai Alam Indah (PAI) is located in the city of Tegal, Central Java. From Jalan Pantura it is only 500 meters away. Although there is no city transportation route to PAI, people can reach it by any means of transportation, including walking.
	            	<br><br>

	            	 PAI is one of the potentials that contributes to local revenue to the Tegal City Government through the collection of entrance tickets and parking fees. Previously, PAI was not yet organized. The gardens and facilities in it are still minimal, even though the public's interest in this tourist attraction is quite large, especially on Sundays and national holidays. However, after 2004, the local government, slowly, began to seriously manage by fixing several important parts, including beautifying the landscaping, providing a more representative parking lot, building a mosque, viewing post, and two platforms that can be used to mingle with visitors.
	            	<br><br> 

	            	The Tegal City Government also invited local investors to provide a floating restaurant, complete with a pier. At the end of Adi Winarso's leadership period, a Maritime Monument was even built in the form of a warship equipped with the main equipment of the used weapon system (Alutsista), according to the Indonesian National Armed Forces Navy. This monument was inaugurated by the Chief of Naval Staff (KSAL), Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno and the Deputy Governor of Central Java, Dra. Rustriningsih. The new facility that was built during Ikmal Jaya's leadership is the provision of water games, water boom, directly opposite the Maritime Monument.

	            	Guci Tegal Tourism offers the charm of natural beauty typical of the Tropics. This can be felt by visitors since they were still on their way. Typical scenery in the form of expanse of rice fields, gardens of strawberries, tomatoes, carrots, chilies, and pine forests, plus the cool temperature, is truly a typical highland tourist attraction. At the Guci Tegal tourist site, apart from soaking in the baths, visitors can also soak in the river that flows in the middle of the tourist site. The river water is also hot water which has the same content as the pond, because the water source is the same.
